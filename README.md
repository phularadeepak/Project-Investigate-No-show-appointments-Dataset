# Project-Investigate-No-show-appointments-Dataset
No-show appointments dataset contains information about the Patient appointments in Brazil and the data fields are- ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital. ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família. No show- ‘No’ means if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

The following questions will be answered after the Data Analysis-
1) How many patients showed up to their appointments and how many of them enrolled in welfare program? 2) What is the number of Male and Female patients? 3) Which is the age group having maximum patients? 4) Which hour of the day has maximum appointments in the dataset? 5) Which are the top 5 hospitals having maximum appointments?
